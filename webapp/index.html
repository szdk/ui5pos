            info about following bootstrap script tag
            id : required for identification of this script by ui5
            src: path to sap-ui-core library (it is set to resources/sap-ui-core.js, if the current application is served using "UI5 serve" command,
                    the resources/.. path is automatically resolved by ui5 server in the backend and all of the required files are provided to the request)
            data-sap-ui-onInit: the script that needs to be run once sap.ui.core library is loaded
            data-sap-ui-resourceroots: provide an alias name (in our case, ui5pos.szdk) to the specified directory (in our case it is current directory)
                                        this alias name will be used everywhere inside our html as well as js files
                                        one example is the data-sap-ui-onInit parameter, which uses the alias name to access index.js file in current directory
